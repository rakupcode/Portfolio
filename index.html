				<h3>Welcome to rakup.cf!</h3>
				<h5>My personal website created out of curiosity to learn, now become my favorite workplace.
				</h5>
				<p>Hello World! My name is Raushan Kumar. I am a student of engineering and also very fond of reading and writing. 
					Explore this website to know more about the learning process and writing aspects of mine.</p>
				<p>
					My first book <a href="https://amzn.to/2UTZKJo">'I won't let you go'</a> was published on amazon kindle. It is a narative poetry about a fatherless child. 
					You can follow me on <a href="https://amzn.to/3Blgd93">Amazon Authors Page</a> for updates.</p>
				<p>
					I created this website out of html and css. As I am still trying to understand javascript, I used only a little of it. 
					And I still have to learn many things, so I started my blog with the help of wordpress at <a href="http://blog.rakup.cf">blog.rakup.cf</a>.
